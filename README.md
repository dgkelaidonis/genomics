# genomics
This repo includes reusable code for supporting the development of bio-informatics applications that focus on the Data Analytics of genome sequencing.
The main idea relates to the provision of set of different **java libraries** that can be used for building up more complex data analytics solutions that process the genome data.

## Breaking down the Genomics components
Below we provide the basic information about the parts that are involved to the **Genomics**, with the help of [genome.gov](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/A-Brief-Guide-to-Genomics). 

In particular, Genomics could roughly classified (bottom-up) as follow: 
- **DNA:** a chemical compound that contains the instructions needed to develop and direct the activities of nearly all living organisms.Instructions are built using a 4-letters alphabet, "A-T-G-C". These are the **bases**, that relate to: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). Finally, the DNA is formed by billions of **bases pairs** in correlation of "A-T" and "G-C".
- **Gene:** is a specific fragment of DNA that codes for a protein while genome is the entire collection of DNA of an organism that contains the entire genetic information, that is structured by A-T-G-C alphabet.
  - **Genosome:** is the combination of thousands (over 20.000) genes, that finally forms the genetic information of an organism and it comprices the DNA. 
- **Histone:** gene is part of the histones, that are highly basic proteins found in eukaryotic cell nuclei that pack and order the DNA into structural units called nucleosomes. 
- **Nucleosome:** is a structural unit of a eukaryotic chromosome, consisting of a length of DNA coiled around a core of histones.
- **Chromosome:** a threadlike structure of nucleic acids and protein found in the nucleus of most living cells, carrying genetic information in the form of **Genes**.
 - **Cell:** is the main building block of the Organism's cells include many different copies of DNA

A high-level representation of the above concepts, is provided [here](https://www.genome.gov/sites/default/files/inline-images/brief_genomics_0.jpg).

## Scope of this repo contents
The source code that is included into this repo, focus to the provision of capabilities for the advanced data analytics of the DNA alphabet, i.e., the A-T-G-C pairs, that compose the genome sequencing.
